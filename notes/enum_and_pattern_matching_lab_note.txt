[Enumerations]
	enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible varients
		-enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values

	the enum called Option expresses that a value can be either something or nothing

	with a value that has a fixed amount of posibilities we can give rust all of the possible varients

	enums are declared as types which makes them able to be used as arguments in functions

	enums can also have data directly attached to the varient
		-in this case a string type

		enum IpAddr {
			V4(String),
			V6(String),
		}

		the type of data can be any thing including struct types

[The Option enum]
	an enum from the standard library 
	
	The Option type encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing.

	because rust doesn't have the null feature this type is huge to tell if the desired value is something or nothing

	Option is so useful that its included in the prelude; meaning that you don't need to bring it into scope explicitly	

	the <T> syntax in the Option<T> enum is a generic type parameter meaning that it can hold one value of any type 

	the difference between Option<T> and Null is that the compiler won't let us use an Option<T> value as if it were definitely a valid value

	to use Option<T> types with their non Option counter part they must be converted from an Option<T> to a T type. 

[Match Control Flow Construct]

	the match control flow construct allows you to compare a value against a 
	series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches.

	match can be thought of as a coin-sorting machine
	
	as long as the expression of the arm is short enough to fit on one line curly braces arn't needed
	
	if multiple lines are needed curly braces must be used 
		- in this case the comma after the expression is optional.
	
	match <var> {
		< arm > => <expression>
		<case1> => <value to return>,
		<case2> => {<Code to execute>}<optional comma>
	}

	match arms are also able to bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern
		-this is how we can extract the value out of the enum varients.
