[Enumerations]
	enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible varients
		-enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values

	the enum called Option expresses that a value can be either something or nothing

	with a value that has a fixed amount of posibilities we can give rust all of the possible varients

	enums are declared as types which makes them able to be used as arguments in functions

	enums can also have data directly attached to the varient
		-in this case a string type

		enum IpAddr {
			V4(String),
			V6(String),
		}

		the type of data can be any thing including struct types
