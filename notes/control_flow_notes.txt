[If_expressions]
	- allows you to branch your code depending on conditions using keywords "if" and "else"
	- multiple conditions can be used by using and "else if" expression
	- the condition has to result in a bool for the if statement to work

		if <expression> {
			<code to exec if true>
		} else if <second expression> { 
			<code to exec if true>
		} else {
			<code to exec if above expressions are false>
		}

	- if expressions can be made without an else statement which would cause the code to just move on to the next operation

	- if expressions can be used in a let statement to assign the outcome to a variable
		the if and else values must have a similar type based on the first type.
