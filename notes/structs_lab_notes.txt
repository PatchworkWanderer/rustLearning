[Structs]
	a struct is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group
		-similar to on object's data attribute in object-orientated languages
		-structs and enums are the building blocks for creating new types in your program's domain to take full advantage of Rust's compile-time type checking
	
	structs are similar to tuples in that both hold multiple related values and can be different types
		they differ from tuples in that you name each piece of data so its clear what the values mean. making structs more flexible

	sample define of a struct				creation of a struct instance

	struct <name> {							let <name> = <struct_name> {
		<field1>: <type>,						<field1>: <value>,
		<field2>: <type>,						<field2>: <value>,
		<field3>: <type>,						<field3>: <value>,
	}										};

	to use a specific value from a struct use dot notation 
		<object_name>.<field>
