[Ownership]
a set of rules that govern how a rust program manages memory.

this is used to manage how rust uses a computers memory while it is executing a program

[Stack]
	the stack stores values in the order that it recieves them in a "last in, first out" way
	
	adding data to the stack is call pushing to the stack

	deleting data from the stack is called popping of the stack

	must have a fixed known size

[Heap]
	the heap is a less organized way to store values in memory

	when allocating on the heap you request for an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being used, then returns a pointer to that space
	
	a
