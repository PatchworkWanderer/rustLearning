# rustLearning
Welcome this repo is just a collection of little projects while I work on learning the rust language.

I have split the projects and notes into two different directories based on the topic of the section in the book.

each section has a corresponding txt file in the notes dir 

source code for each project is going to be located here -> rustProjects/<project_name>/src/main.rs
